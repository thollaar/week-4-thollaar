    "### Explanation of the Waist-to-Hips Ratio:\n",
    "  The <strong>waist-hip ratio</strong> or <strong>waist-to-hip ratio (WHR)</strong> is the dimensionless ratio of the circumference of the waist to that of the hips. \n",
    "  This is calculated as waist measurement divided by hip measurement (W ÷ H). \n",
    "  For example, a person with a 30″ (76 cm) waist and 38″ (97 cm) hips has a waist-hip ratio of about 0.78. \n",

    "### Relevance Waist-to-Hips Ratio:  \n",
    "WHR is an easy, inexpensive, and accurate way to see how much body fat you have. It can also help predict your risk for heart disease and diabetes.\n",
    "A few studies suggest that WHR is even more accurate than BMI for predicting the risks of cardiovascular disease and premature deathTrusted Source. For example, a 2015 study of more than \n",
    "15,000 adults showed that a high WHR was linked to an increased risk of early death — even in people with a normal BMI.\n",
    "This method could be particularly useful in certain groups of people. For example, WHR may be a better gauge of obesity in older adults whose body composition has changed. \n",

    "#10. __Discussion Questions__\n",
    "#  * How long did it take you to figure out how to do a bullet list in Markdown? What other formatting tricks did you try?\n",
    "#    Answer: it only took me several minutes to do a bullet list in Markdown, since I used the suggested link in the 3rd codeblock with markdown syntax.\n",
    "#    I tried the formatting tricks for lists (numbers: 1. 2. 3. 4. etc.), dash '-', star '*'\n",
    "\n",
    "#  * Was there any code that you thought was particularly elegant? How about cryptic or buggy?\n",
    "#     Answer: Yes, the following prewritten code: \"raw_rows = [r.rstrip('\\n').split(',') for r in raw_lines]\" was elegant in a single-line whereby multiple commands where added.\n",
    "\n",
    "#  * What does the code `raw_lines = list(f)` in the first code cell do exactly? Where can we learn more about loading files? Why do we bother closing the file at the end of the cell?\n",
    "#   Answer: The code `raw_lines = list(f)` assigns a newly defined variable to a list of 'f' with multiple elements\n",
    "#   We can learn more about loading files by typing: 'help(open)'\n",
    "#   We opened the file as read-only in this case so we didn't need closing it in this particular case when u add 'r' for read-only\n",
    "#   - but it is good practice so you will never accidently write over the original dataset/dataframe and won't lose original data\n",
    "            \n",
    "#  * In the second code cell, why do we try to clean up the data all at once? Why not just deal with it as raw strings?\n",
    "#   Answer: We first need to get rid of the /n and comma's in the CSV file, else Python will just think it is a long string instead of a dataframe with multiple items. \n",
    "#   We clean up the data besides the headers which are string. In order to make calculations later.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#  * What is going on in the line below, also from the second code cell?  \n",
    "#  ```raw_rows = [r.rstrip('\\n').split(',') for r in raw_lines]```\n",
    "#   Answer: string.rstrip() method in this case removes string: `\\n` for all the items: 'r' in list: 'raw_rows'\n",
    "#   Note: Python recognizes \\\"\\\\r\\\", \\\"\\\\n\\\", and \\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\" as line boundaries for 8-bit strings (source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-string-rstrip/)\\n\",\n",
    "    # S.split(sep=None, maxsplit=-1) method in this case returns a list of the words in 'r', using the comma ',' as the delimiter string.\n",
    "\n",
    "#  * What does this do?  \n",
    "#  ```for raw_row in raw_rows[1:]:```\n",
    "#    Answer: this creates a for-loop whereby each item (called: raw_row, arbitrary name) in the list raw_rows from the 2nd item (item 1, counts start at 0) up untill the end of the list (since no ending number was given) \n",
    "#            will be iterated and in the for-loop a condition can be given which can affect each item in the list \n",
    "\n",
    "#  * In the third code cell, a list is extended by another list. What does that mean and how is that different from appending list items to the list? How could we do the same thing using `append()`?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#  * When might the calculation\n",
    "#  ```w2h_ratio = row[1]/row[2]``` give inaccurate results?\n",
    "#  Answer: In the case the resulting division will result in a number with decimals. That is why a float is more accurate in this case\n",
    "#  example: w2h_ratio = float(row[1])/float(row[2])\n",
    "#  Also see Table above with decimals for resulting floats when dividing Waist by Hip\n"
